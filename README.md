This tool is my own personal creation to understand the structure of BCMDL files and for learning purposes.  
This tool is still a work in progress, but will eventually be able to read and write files.

We don't know when it will be completed, as we are prioritizing our real-life plans, but it would be very helpful if you could sit back with a cup of coffee and watch it quietly.
